            My hobby is Painting, I paint in my free time. Painting helps me relax and stops me from getting bored. I like to paint scenery. Painting helps you observe things better. This is something that is good to do after school or whenever you are bored. Painting is something that I like and it is fun. You can easily do painting with the help of youtube videos, and more.
            
            
            According to research from the National Center of Biotechnology Information, painting enables the ability to think in a different manner, encouraging open-ended thought and creativity. In addition to creativity.
            
            There are cognitive and cerebral benefits to painting. We use our brains when we paint or draw, and this not only releases endorphins, but helps build new connections and pathways. When painting, we actively use both sides of our brain, the right for creativity, and the left for logical thinking. This strengthens both and helps develop the ability to focus and think strategically. Painting, like many other art forms, aids in relaxation and stress relief by forcing us to pay attention to details in the environment, which mimics the experience of mediation. painting is also said to relieve stress and improve focus, as it relieves your brain from the strain of continuous concentration. This, in turn, allows you to relax.</p>

        <p> Leonardo da Vinci (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect.While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo's genius epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works compose a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.
